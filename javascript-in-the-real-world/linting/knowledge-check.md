- What is linting?
  - tools that scan your code and reports when errors to style rules are found--sometimes even having the ability to auto fix the errors
  - improves code reviews since linting acts as a pre-code review already

- Which problems can linting prevent?
  - common issues and errors such as space between function names and parentheses--using double quotes or single quotes around strings
  - syntax errors before execution
  - different styling between engineers--linting makes it look like a codebase was written by 'one person'

- Why should you use Prettier?
  - automatically formats JS code according to a set of rules--specifically targets layout of code and makes decisions about spacing, indentation levels, and line-breaks
