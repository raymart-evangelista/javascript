- What is a component's lifecycle? And, explain the most important lifecycle methods.
  - Creation of the component (componentDidMount)
    - runs when component is inserted into the DOM tree
    - common tasks that are done in this method are:
      - connect to web APIs or JavaScript frameworks
      - set timers using setTimeout or setInterval
      - add event listeners
  - Render of the component (render)
    - the `render()` method contains all the logic your component should display on the screen
  - (optional) Update of the component (componentDidUpdate)
    - not called for the initial render--but called any other time that the component updates
    - prone to inf loops if used to update state in a way that causes re-render, so conditional statement should be included for prevention
    - method is great place for when operating on the DOM when the component has updated
      - also useful for sending network requests when conditions are met (e.g. if user changed accounts, fetch the data for that new account during this method)
  - Death of the component (componentWillUnmount)
    - called when component is removed form the DOM tree
    - usually doing cleanup tasks in this method, often cleaning up what was added in the componentDidMount method
      - e.g. removing event listeners, cancelling network requests, other clean up routines

  - A component can be in different states of its "life", and in React we can use those states to handle certain tasks

- Which tasks should be triggered at the various lifecycle stages of a component?
  - `componentDidMount()`
    - initiate API calls, loading data from remote endpoint
    - `setState()` for special cases like tooltips, modals, other concepts when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its position
  - `componentDidUpdate()`
    - updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes
    - `setState()`, however incorrect usage can lead to infinite loop--so wrap it in a condition to check for changes form previous state
  - `componentWillUnmount()`
    - cleanup tasks
      - `window.removeEventListener(...)`
    - can't modify component state
