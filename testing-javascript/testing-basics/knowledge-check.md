- What are the benefits of TDD?
  - primary goal is specification and not validation
  - thinking through requirements or design before writing functional code
  - the steps of tdd include:
    - add a test, enough test for your code to fail
    - run tests, often the complete test suite to ensure new test does in fact fail
    - update functional code to make it pass the new tests
    - run tests again, fi tests fail, update functional code and retest until the tests pass
  - keeps you out of the debugger
  - reduces bugs in new and existing features
  - reduces cost of change
  - improves design
  - encourages refactoring
  - forces you to slow down and think

- What are some common jest matchers?
  - `toBe()`, `toEqual`, `toStrictEqual` (`toStrictEqual` is preferred over `toEqual`)
  - `not` (e.g.: `not.toBe()`)
